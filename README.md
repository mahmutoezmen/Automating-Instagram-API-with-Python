The program works pretty well so far but in case of any problems I have to put disclaimer statement here:

Firstly, install the unofficial API
pip install InstagramApi

Once we get the users list, it is time to follow these users.

IMPORTANT NOTE: set time limit as much as you can to avoid automation detection.
